Thanks for purchasing the Universal Human: Base Version!

Before using this product, please ensure you have read the License Agreement at https://sites.google.com/view/universalhuman/license-agreement

Note for users of Blender 2.80 and higher: To maintain compatibility, the .blend file was created in Blender 2.79, which means the 2.79 UI layout will be loaded (complete with footers instead of headers). To prevent this, disable "Load UI" in Blender's File View before loading the file.

Rig and upgrade instructions can be found here: https://sites.google.com/view/universalhuman/instructions

Version updates are outlined in the Release Log here: https://sites.google.com/view/universalhuman/release-log
